A series of practical guides and explorations on how to build a cluster organization in eight steps. Overview and a brief introduction to the series and how it came to be.

## How to build a cluster organization in 8 steps | overview

### Fundamentals

1. Understand the cluster — is it a cluster?
2. Know people, needs, motivations and existing assets — the who
3. Define what you want to achieve — the why
4. Make a plan how to get there — the how and what

### Building

5. Create governance and organizational model — how do we organize?
6. Finance the cluster organization — how do we finance the cluster organization?
7. Communicate the cluster organization’s value-add and activities — “sharing is caring”
8. Measure and learn — what works and what doesn’t

Plenty of resources exist on clusters, cluster development and cluster organizations. The first time I got in touch with the topic was when I started working together with Nicolai S. Rottbøll. He was a key figure in setting up and later managing the Copenhagen Cleantech Cluster — now called CLEAN. Nicolai went on to share his practical experiences through training and advisory. My learning journey around cluster development meant the encounter with a field that appeared to be heavy and difficult to access — sometimes very academic and sometimes too bureaucratic.

In the next few months, I will share a series of articles on how to build a cluster organization in eight steps. The goal is to keep it simple and basic, pragmatic and practical, as well as explore fields that might benefit from the cluster development field or vice versa might add new perspectives to cluster organizations, their managers and those who drive cluster development.
My hope is to help to navigate the process of setting up a cluster organization and create the basis for conversations with cluster practitioners and those interested in the topic.

This article marks the start of the series. As I progress, I will continuously edit and revise it.

## Introducing the eight steps on building cluster organizations

### 1. Understand the cluster — is it a cluster?

Nothing comes from nothing. Respectively, a cluster organization evolves from an existing cluster. The first step of building a cluster organization is thus to check: is it a cluster? This entails understanding what a cluster is and getting to know the cluster through research drawing for example from market and sector analyses. I also believe this step might benefit from system thinking and its respective tools.

If it is a cluster, the next question is whether it needs a cluster organization. It can benefit from one where an existing cluster and network of organizations either falls short in performance (something could be better) or showcases gaps (not yet performed benefits).

Eoin Byrne, Cluster Manager at Cyber Ireland, wrote an excellent article, I believe, sits nicely with this first step. Initial Cluster Analysis

### 2. Know people, needs, motivations and existing assets — the who

A cluster organization is a multi-stakeholder project involving many hands and minds. Typically, a cluster organization brings together businesses, governments and academia. Knowing what motivates them, what is challenging, what capabilities and goals they have, is the very basis for pretty much everything else.

The second step is about reaching out, understanding better, mobilizing and a critical point to create momentum.

Eoin also shared a helpful article from his work that fits well here, too. Identifying the Need — Opportunities and Challenges for Industry

### 3. Define what you want to achieve — the why

A deeper and better understanding of the challenges and needs, as well as existing assets and capabilities of the cluster as a whole and the actors within, provide the basis to define what the cluster organizations aspire to achieve. This basis is important, because it helps to stay clear of fluffy vision/mission formulations, and formulate statements instead that are rooted in the lived experiences of the cluster participants.

This is a collaborative step. The results must be shared and co-owned with the core group of people and organizations that are in it to shape the cluster organization together.

### 4. Make a plan how to get there — the how and what

Develop a guiding policy that informs how the cluster organizations intend and plan to implement a coherent set of actions. Both the guiding policy and the coherent actions must clearly link to the challenges, needs, and existing assets, as well as the vision.
