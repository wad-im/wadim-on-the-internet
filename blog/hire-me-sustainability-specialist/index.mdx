Strengthen your sustainability management team... I look forward to switch to the "client side" after 5 years in sustainability strategy consulting - most recently as senior project manager at [Quercus Group](https://quercus-group.com/) in Copenhagen, Denmark.

I invite you to reach out to me at **hello@wadimbaslow.com**.

In the last 5 years, I worked

- with public, academic, civic society and corporate clients, from and in projects
- in Scandinavia (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland), Europe (Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, Slowenia, UK), East & West Africa (Ghana, Kenya), North America (US, Canada) and Asia (Singapore, China, Indonesia),
- with a focus on sustainability, transition and innovation across sectors & topics, among others, like business sustainability, water, waste, circular economy, sustainable urban development, export promotion & regional economic development, humanitarian innovation, and
- across the project lifecycle from research, strategy development to implementation & integration.

My time in consulting has been my professional adolescence time - putting learnings into practice of the real world - after studying sustainability at university.

Today, **I am a sustainability specialist.**

Allow me to highlight three experience & competency areas, I believe, are an asset to meet the strategic and everyday challenges of sustainability management:

## Sustainability native

I helped clients to gain clarity on their sustainability journey. The business sustainability ecosystem expanded greatly in the past years - principles, frameworks, tools, directives and stakeholders - making sustainability management a big task. As a sustainability native I can confidently navigate the sustainability landscape through

- my hands-on, professional experience in sustainability with different sectors and type of clients, and
- my academic background covering sustainability from a natural science (chemistry, physics, ecology), social science (communication, governance, management, …) and engineering (water, waste, mobility, energy,…) perspectives.

## Management Professional

Past and recent clients enjoyed working with me for the ability to support everyday hands-on tasks at quality and keep the overall picture and process at the same time.

I can rely and so can you on my managerial toolbox from a career in strategy consulting and project management.

## Stakeholder Management

Integrating sustainability across the company is too a large part a question of working together with internal stakeholders across organizational functions. It equally demands an aptitude to manage a great number of external actors.

I am good at stakeholder management on the strategic level (e.g. engagement strategy) and practical level (e.g. facilitating workshops, moderating conferences, ...).

The silver lining of my interdisciplinary profile is collaboration. At Quercus Group, I designed, facilitated and managed multi-stakeholder initiatives - projects that typically include actors of different backgrounds at different stages of the project. At university, I was drawn towards areas like collaborative governance or co-creation.

## Hire me

If my profile resonates with you, your business and your sustainability ambitions, I would be happy to meet you. Don't hesitate to reach out anytime hello@wadimbaslow.com or on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wbaslow/).

Thank you,

Wadim
