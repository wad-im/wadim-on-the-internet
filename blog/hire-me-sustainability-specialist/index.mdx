Strengthen your sustainability management team with an experienced and innovative team member.

I really look forward to working inside a corporate team that is developing and/or implementing sustainability across the organisation. Over the past 5 years I have worked with numerous organisations to both start and strengthen their sustainability strategy and actions - through my work as as senior project manager at [Quercus Group](https://quercus-group.com/) in Copenhagen, Denmark.

If you are looking for a new team member, with an academic background in sustainability (M.Sc.) and environmental economics (B.Sc.), then I invite you to reach out to me at **hello@wadimbaslow.com**.

Over the last 5 years, I have worked with purpose, and have experienced the challenges faced, and worked on solutions for, numerous public, academic, civic society and corporate clients.

This experience geographically stretches into Scandinavia (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland), Europe (Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, Slowenia, UK), East & West Africa (Ghana, Kenya), North America (US, Canada) and Asia (Singapore, China, Indonesia).

Much of my past work focused on sustainability, transition and innovation across sectors & topics. This includes sustainability in practice (incl. water, waste, circular economy, sustainable urban development, export promotion & regional economic development, humanitarian innovation), and the process of change (incl. research, strategy development & roadmapping), and implementation & integration.

My time in consulting has been my professional adolescence time - putting learnings into practice of the real world - after studying sustainability at university.

Today, **I am a sustainability specialist.**

Allow me to highlight three of my core competency areas, that I believe, are an asset to the next team that I work with:

## Sustainability native

The business sustainability ecosystem has expanded greatly in the recent past - principles, frameworks, tools, directives and stakeholders - making sustainability management a big task. As a sustainability native I have helped clients gain greater clarity on their sustainability journey, and I help them confidently navigate the sustainability landscape based on my:

- my hands-on, professional experience in addressing sustainability with different sectors and type of clients, and
- my academic background covering sustainability from a natural science (chemistry, physics, ecology), social science (communication, governance, management, …) and engineering (water, waste, mobility, energy,…) perspectives.

## Management Professional

The clients I worked with in the past have recognised my ability to support their teams with everyday hands-on tasks while delivering quality with a strategic mindset. This is coupled with my managerial toolbox acquired from my many consulting activities that included strategy development and project management.

## Stakeholder Management

The success of integrating sustainability across an organisation is highly dependent on working together with internal stakeholders across organizational functions, and it equally dependent on an aptitude to manage the expectations and contributions of external stakeholders.

I have proven to be good at stakeholder management at both the strategic level (e.g. engagement strategy) and practical level (e.g. facilitating workshops, moderating conferences, ...).

The silver lining of my interdisciplinary profile is collaboration. At Quercus Group, I designed, facilitated and managed many multi-stakeholder initiatives - projects that typically include actors of different backgrounds at different stages of the project. While academically I am drawn towards areas like collaborative governance or co-creation.

## Your next team member

If my profile resonates with you, your team, or your business's sustainability ambitions, I would be happy to meet you. Don't hesitate to reach out anytime hello@wadimbaslow.com or on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wbaslow/).

Thank you,

Wadim
