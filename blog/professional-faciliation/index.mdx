A safe space and trust are important for an effective collaboration of a diverse group of people working on a difficult problem.

What we bring as facilitators to such a group influences the extent to which everyone has the opportunity to contribute and move forward together despite differences. Preconceived ideas of how we ought to facilitate based on 'job titles' or what we believe is professional is often an obstacle to a transformative process. Instead, bringing ourselves as whole with the good traits and also our quirks makes us more approachable. It makes us more human and thereby sets the ground for trust in the group.

## Be true to yourself for effective facilitation

'_My hands are sweaty! I am excited to be with you here today_', I exclaimed at the beginning of facilitating one of in my career's first workshops in Kisumu, Kenya, after I told them how pro athletes before competing appear nervous (sweaty hands, nervous appearance), and when asked in an interview 'are you nervous?', would often respond 'No, I am excited!'.

I was very nervous. Yet, my intention was not to reframe my own nervousness to excitement. I wanted to come out with it. We started the workshop together laughing about it. I relaxed into the process, and so I also felt the group was more comfortable with me as facilitator.

In the summer 2021, I worked together with French and Spanish companies in the wind energy and advanced materials sector on circular economy. It was part of the '[Towards Green Transition Facility](https://clustercollaboration.eu/in-focus/green/towards-green-transition-facility)' by the EU, which matched experts in sustainability with innovation clusters across Europe. The first workshop turned out very stiff and I was unsatisfied with the energy and the outcomes. On the second workshop, I facilitated a role play exercise that I picked up from [Rob Hopkins](https://twitter.com/robintransition): '_Close your eyes, imagine a door, walk through it and on the other side it is the year 2030. How does this world like? What if the wind energy sector is fully circular?_'. The exercise made me appear childish, perhaps foolish when I insisted to view everything from 2030 when participants defaulted to describing issues from 2021. Yet, it spurred the creative energy I hoped to instil into process.

I facilitated numerous workshops in my professional life in the past five years. I worked with stakeholders from European corporates, executives from North America, China and India, civic society leaders in Denmark and East Africa, teachers and students in Ghana, waste pickers from informal settlements in Kenya, and many more.

When I facilitated more informal, down-to-earth, and playful events the engagement and the results were more interesting, creative and better. When I thought I need to be more professional and facilitate a more formal experience, the engagement was less lively and the results less surprising.

Bringing more of myself rather than acting out a role usually created a better experience for the participants and myself - regardless of participant type like executives.

## 'Being professional' is an obstacle for effective facilitation

In spring 2021, I provided four training sessions on creative facilitation for a group of cluster managers from Spain, Portugal and France in the textile sector. 'We work with CEOs, business people and politicians', they'd say expressing a concern that the facilitation methods that I proposed were inadequate for their formal context.

I read two things in this sentiment:

- the fear of rejection, and
- the belief professionalism is incompatible with more informal, fun and creative practices.

### Fear of rejection

The cluster manager's job is similar to the facilitator's job. Both take an intermediary role of bringing a diverse set of stakeholders together and coordinate joint activities. Success is measured for example by the number of members and joint activities as a measure for engagement.

The opposite would be not attracting, perhaps even loose members and with them funding etc. Similarly, in facilitation we don't want to loose stakeholders and engagement.

The concern for pleasing members, stakeholders or participants leads us to adapt towards their expectations, or what we assume they are. Not doing so, we are afraid of their rejection. The adaptation towards assumed expectations, I believe, is mistaken for professionalism.

'Being professional' then becomes meeting the expectations (often assumed) of others in the process.

However, we rob others of the chance to genuinely connect with us if we adapt towards them. Perhaps others do so, too. Then we don't get to work together beyond the surface level. It becomes an obstacle to build trust.

### Believing professionalism is incompatible with creative facilitation

Can you have fun facilitating and remain professional? Absolutely! I don’t think that more fun, informal and creative facilitation practices and professionalism are mutually exclusive at all.

> Are you a professional? This is someone who offers expertise and impact and time and commitment — all the elements necessary to achieve results. And the professional does it on command, for hire, for an exchange of value. ([Professionals produce with intent](https://sethgodinwrites.medium.com/professionals-produce-with-intent-cc603f230a32) - Seth Godin).

I found this definition Louis Grenier's newsletter '[Everyone hates marketers](https://www.everyonehatesmarketers.com/)'' article '”[Being professional” is utter bullshit](https://www.everyonehatesmarketers.com/articles/professionalism)', which resonated with me and inspired this blogpost.

Outward signals like how we dress or the language that we use are often associated with the work that we do. I worked in consulting my whole career so far. Of course, we want others to know that we are good in what we do.

Inspired by Seth Godin's definition above, facilitators help others to work better together and move forward on difficult problems.

I think more fun, informal and creative facilitation does not make us less professional, but often times more professional because these creative practices open a wider horizon of possibility.

## Methods I used that were more fun than plenary discussions...

In past and recent facilitation projects, I introduced exercises and activities where I was worried how the participants will take it. I was worried it won't be taken as professional:

- **Playing music.** I play music especially in virtual set-ups. It is usually taken with positive surprise and added to a more relaxed start and process of our joint work.
- **Games.** Games of all kinds work fantastically as ice breakers and conversation starters alike. I am listening the '[The Amble Podcast](https://amble.studio/podcast/)' which explores games, strategy and facilitation. It inspires me to look into games beyond exercises in facilitation.
- **Role Play.** Role play makes the creative juices flow and I used it regularly in strategic scenarios planning and backcasting exercises, which sound very technical but in form of role play become really fun and also transformative. I started using it more often inspired by Rob Hopkins book '[What is to what if](https://www.robhopkins.net/the-book/)'.
- **Drawing.** I have not used it very often but when I did it usually worked great and better than expected. Drawing can be tricky because many of us believe that we cannot draw. I once co-facilitated a workshop with senior executives of large Singaporean company and its partners. Singaporean companies are quite hierarchical. Unexpectedly, drawing worked great also with high level business executives.
- **Toy bricks.** I am based in Denmark. Maybe it is even expected of me to facilitate with the famous toy bricks. Using toy bricks are great for all kinds of exercises in facilitation. Unfortunately, I usually don't have access to them and so have not used them a lot in my facilitation experience.

## Vertical and horizontal facilitation

The notion of 'being professional' can be misleading. What we think is professional is often a concern what might be perceived as professional and not what is actually professional. This is detrimental to genuinely transformative facilitation, because

- it creates boundaries between the facilitator and the participants, where connections would actually be needed, and
- these boundaries limit what is brought to the process, both by the facilitator and the participants, and so limits also the horizon of possible outcomes.

Instead, I propose to seek to overcome the initial fear of rejection and expand the toolbox of facilitation method with more fun, informal and playful exercises, because

- it removes obstacles of building trust. Trust is essential to connections and the genuine connections are crucial to move forward on intractable problems as a group; and
- more creative practices open the horizon of perspectives onto a problem and how it might be resolved. They help create more innovative solutions.

I am not advocating against formal approaches to facilitation. Personally, I lean more towards informal approaches. Informal approaches can sometimes feel as they don't lead to concrete outcomes whereas formal facilitation helps to define concrete, discrete action steps.

My practice forward will be to cycle between these two approaches. It is what Adam Kahane suggests in his book '[Facilitating breakthrough](https://reospartners.com/facilitating-breakthrough/)': Cycling between what he calls vertical and horizontal facilitation. This cycling based on the facilitators situational awareness makes transformative facilitation.

Thank you,
