The moment when we make an unexpected discovery is sometimes called serendipity. The sensation of awe and the 'aha'-moment triggers a little release of dopamine. It feels like we got lucky and our horizons expanded.

Major innovations like penicillin or viagra have been accidental discoveries of this kind. Serendipitous moments come by chance. You cannot force it.

What you can do is to make it more likely to occur like companies took serendipity as guiding principle to design open workspaces with centrally located cafés meant to increase the possibility that you bump into your colleagues.

I think serendipity holds the possibility to create change in problematic situations also beyond the single organisation. It can spark genuine change beyond incremental improvements

- by **creating spaces** that make unexpected encounters with others more likely,
- by inviting others with **different perspectives to ours**, and
- stepping a little, but not too much, **out of our comfort zones.**

## Create spaces for random encounters with other people

"_I think public transport is painful. It sucks,_" Elon Musk tweeted few years ago, “_Why do you want to get on something with a lot of other people_, [...]”. It prompted a wave of people sharing stories under the hashtag [#GreatThingsThatHappenedonTransit](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GreatThingsThatHappenedonTransit&src=typed_query) showing the possible beauty of random human encounters. One man wrote _“I met my wife on a train platform” (_'[I met my wife on a train platform': Twitter responds to Elon Musk with positive public transport stories](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/dec/21/elon-musk-public-transport-transit-painful-twitter)).

When I studied sustainable urban development Jan Gehl's work on great public spaces influenced me greatly ([In Search of the Human Scale | Jan Gehl | TEDxKEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgw9oHDfJ4k&ab_channel=TEDxTalks)). Projects of [Gehl Architects](https://gehlpeople.com/) feature for example clever seating and rest areas leaving it open to us to engage, only listen in to conversations, or be on our own as per our comfort.

People's stories from public transport show the potential of places for making unexpected connections and the impact it might have. Jan Gehl and his team's work illustrate the importance of places for humans for the well-being of entire cities. We can also create those places.

For me, key is to design them as invitation and not to force it. Workspaces nudging employees to interact might not create the expected results because we often do not have the option not to engage and remove ourselves.

So, it boils down to creating optionality, spatial proximity and removing barriers to interact.

I wanted people to network and make genuine connections when I hosted the conference type event [Innovate4WASH](https://innovate4wash.quercus-group.com/) in January 2022. It consists mostly of pitches on the main stage. But that is not where to make genuine connections. They are made in-between.

> _If a conference is just a village, then it needs a public square. As an urban designer, I see public space everywhere I go — or lack thereof. Some of the best design of extracurricular set-ups at conferences resemble public squares in a city. The food and drink options are located in an area with lots of seating — recycled shipping pallets or otherwise — which encourages people-watching and deepens the sense of community that every conference simply must aspire to._ (‘[Better Conference Design](https://medium.com/swlh/better-conference-design-ba7cca6b9814)' by Mikael Colville-Andersen)

You cannot force serendipitous moments. They are more likely to occur by creating spaces that make unexpected encounters with others more likely. 'Leveraging space' is an essential practice for triggering serendipity ([Dr. Christian Busch: Cultivating Serendipity for innovation and impact in a fast-changing world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnXhVvWeoK4&ab_channel=ChristianBusch)).

## Invite people who hold different perspectives and types of knowledge

A common innovation platitude is 'thinking outside of the box'. We admit the limits of our current position and acknowledge the need of knowledge outside of it.

I consider myself more on the leftish side of the political spectrum together with its common moral foundations around inclusion, openness and care. In fact, I believe that I am curious and generally open to positions other than my own. Conversations on climate change, economic equity or more recently corona taught me however that I am actually often not as receptive to different views than my own.

Researchers call this the 'confirmation bias', '[_which refers to the human tendency to search only for evidence that confirms our preferred beliefs_](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/). The confirmation bias is a strong psychological force and explains partly why reasoning with those we disagree rarely works.

> _The most reliable cure for confirmation bias is interaction with people who don’t share your beliefs. They confront you with counter-evidence and counterargument. [...] People who think differently and are willing to speak up if they disagree with you make you smarter, almost as if they are extensions of your own brain._ ([Why the past 10 years of American life have been uniquely stupid](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/), Jonathan Haidt).

Jonathan Haidt also emphasises in his book 'The righteous mind - Why good people are divided by politics and religion' the importance '_to have intellectual and ideological diversity within any group or institution_' as an avenue bridging societal divides.

I believe the confrontation with a differing position is central to the wondrous serendipity experience.

Thinking outside the box thus entails to expose ourselves to a diversity of views.

So, it follows that we do not only create the space to engage and invite people to do so. We also need to make sure that we invite a range of people who hold different views of the world in order to tap into the potential of serendipity.

At Innovate4WASH, we invite different kind of participants like entrepreneurs, investors, government agencies and bodies, civic society and others to come closer of the common bond of solving problematic situations within water, sanitation and hygiene.

I recently concluded an advisory assignment for a new cluster organisation in Scotland. The respective sector faces different kinds of challenges. I urged the organisers to engage with companies, academia, government, etc. in a worry that they default to a business federation. The benefit of multi-stakeholder partnerships is the ability to see a problem from different angles, and so find genuinely innovative solutions.

## Step a little bit out of your comfort zone

'[Patterns of Change - Behaviours to guide your nonprofit in times of change](https://patternsforchange.org.uk/) describes a set of behaviours to support change. Each of the seven steps suggests work as organization, work as team, and firstly 'your work'.

It is easy to conceive a space for a diverse set of people to get together - to create the conditions that make serendipitous moments more likely for others and so for innovation or for bridging divides. But what about you?

Frankly, I can sometimes barely tolerate different opinions with family members. Engaging with strangers, who might even profoundly think differently, is a rather anxiety inducing thought. So, it might be natural to avoid this type of situation overall.

What we need to do on a personal level is to step a little bit outside of our comfort zone. Not so much to make us feel overwhelmed or very anxious, just a bit. This takes a lot of courage and sometimes to relax into the support and guidance by a 'knowledgeable other', who creates the safe space to step outside of our comfort.

Developmental psychologist, focusing on how children learn, developed the concept of the zone of proximal development, which resembles this discovery journey within a support system. It describes the space wherein children learn and thrive making new experience with the safety and assurance of supportive parents, teachers, etc. to lean on.

Innovation is also emergent and often an exploration with high uncertainty. Nesta's '[Playbook for Innovation Learning](https://media.nesta.org.uk/documents/nesta_playbook_for_innovation_learning.pdf)' brought the concept of the zone of proximal development into a nice visual (on page 40).

## How serendipity plays into innovation beyond the single organisation

There are three stages translating serendipity into an innovation according to Dr. Christian Busch: the trigger, connecting the dots and acting on it. I think there are three key steps we can take to trigger serendipity moments:

1. Invite people to spaces that encourage interaction to occur more often and at random,
2. Welcome different views, perspectives and experiences to be expressed, and
3. Make it so that it feels safe for the individual to step a little out of their comfort zone.

What awaits a company or a single organisation is the possibility to discover novelty or new insights how to get unstuck in stuck situations. Company's work on employee diversity, workspace design or new time management practices showcase the existing awareness on this level.

I feel it did not arrive, yet, in efforts on the societal level. Climate change, economic inequality or polarized, tribalistic debates about how to proceed as communities and nations. These issues are so overwhelming. They demand solutions beyond incremental improvements.

Fostering the notion of serendipity in the context of these issues, I think, we can potentially step into solutions that take the complexity of these problems into account and help to get unstuck. We can hear multiple voices and types of knowledge to understand the issue from multiple angles, and in this process of discovery lies the opportunity to connect the dots in novel ways.
