The importance of community engagement increases with the sustainable business' evolution from net zero to net positive. It will be a central practice in integrated sustainability management and central shaping a business' sustainable value proposition to the market and how successfully it will manage the radical change. Businesses who create value for multi-stakeholders and community will also comparatively benefit more in the future.

I hope this conceptual introduction to community engagement in business sustainability today and tomorrow resonates with you. I'll cover the topic in different sections (feel free to jump).

## <a name="definition"></a> What is community engagement in business sustainability?

Community engagement in businesses sustainability comprises the strategic processes, relationships, interactions and communication through which a business engages with the communities it operates and/or affects towards seeking sustainable outcomes.

In practice, we can differentiate two fundamentally different approaches.

1. **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)**: Community engagement appears as instrument/activity of a company's CSR strategy and serves the purposes of managing risk, issues and stakeholders;
2. **Integrated Sustainability Strategy**: Community engagement is central to the corporate sustainability strategy and therefore instrumental to strategic differentiation (sustainable value proposition) as well as managing change inside and outside the organization.

Civic society organisations sometimes use community engagement to mitigate negative (unintended) harm on communities of an intervention. Similarly, companies employ community engagement in CSR in conjunction to compliance and risk management. They intend to establish and maintain legitimacy and accountability.

Engaging with communities in the integrated sustainability strategy however is more similar to the classic voluntary work in associations, clubs, etc. of individuals and groups of community members to the benefit of the whole community. Both share the intention to build and strengthen social capital and social cohesion, and ultimately create value for more than one.

Sometimes, community engagement is used as a marketing tool. Especially in the past years community building and engagement emerged as an alternative sales and marketing approach to attract and bind customers to a business.

Dread carefully though, because using community engagement in marketing sustainability intend is quickly uncovered as green washing.

## <a name="risk-mgt"></a> Community engagement as risk management

For the most time in the evolution of business sustainability, companies have been using community engagement for regulatory compliance and to maintain the social licence to operate. The main concern is often reputational. Its place is often within corporate social responsibility.

Infrastructure or energy companies (fossil and renewable alike) for example often need to engage with communities to comply with planning regulations (e.g. performing impact assessments that include social aspects). At the same time, these companies regularly experience public backlash as a risk to their projects. In both aspects, they engage with communities to obtain the licence to proceed with their projects.

Lately, community engagement in business sustainability emerged as a tool to meet ambitions in the manner of 'net zero', which is more commonly associated with a company's greenhouse gas emissions. 'Net zero' in social sustainability is better described as 'doing no harm'.

The social dimension of CSR and sustainability management has often been neglected. On many occasions the focus lies on the workspace, e.g. through activities designed to increase employee well-being in the company. Sustainability reports will often mention inclusion and diversity as central elements in their sustainability efforts on the social side. As long as the latter efforts exist, a company's ESG rating would be great even if a company's impact on people outside the company is disastrous.

Typical activities of community engagement in CSR efforts are for example

- Charity donations and sponsorships in areas like sports & athletics, art & culture, education, disaster response (see Covid, Ukraine), and other forms of community support
- Initiatives to support, up-skill and integrate local workforce,
- Voluntary work like allowing employees to allocate time for community-focused activities, special voluntary initiatives, allocation of a percentage from the salary towards charitable causes,
- Collaboration with NGOs.

The purpose of community engagement in corporate social responsibility can be categorized in three main objectives:

- **Risk Management** as managing the knowledge accountability of the impact a business has on environment and society (externalities),
- **Issue Management** as identifying latent, emerging and mature issues that pose a risk on the business and as management of the respective strategic and operational responses to meet those issues,
- **Stakeholder Management** as identifying and weighing the importance of stakeholders, and as management of key relationships. Stakeholder management in a way also serves risk and issue management.

The features characteristic to community management applied towards these purposes are

- the defensive approach,
- the peripheral, separate or scattered functions it takes within the organization (similar to CSR),
- dis-integrated relationship of the company towards the company and even wider set of stakeholders,
- it submits directly to the short-term maximisation of the economic bottom-line.

However, as societies demand a greater level of contribution from the private sector to a joint sustainable transition, business indeed began re-thinking their role in this transition. Businesses' pledges for net zero or 'do no harm' principle based on internationally agreed conventions mirror the shift in approaches to business sustainability.

Net zero and doing no harm have become the bare minimum (which many companies do not meet, yet). In the evolution of business sustainability, the next question is how companies can do more than the minimum.

The pro-active engagement of a business with this question is not zero-sum. I believe the opposite will be most likely true in the future. Doing more does not exclude profitable business if a company successfully sets itself apart through a sustainable value proposition, innovative business models and managing change both within the company and outside.

Community engagement will play a more central role in a company's pursuit to develop a sustainable comparative advantage and future proof its business.

## <a name="reporting"></a> Sustainability reporting and community engagement

The landscape of principles, frameworks and tools for sustainability reporting is huge and growing rapidly.

Reporting on social sustainability most commonly requires providing proof of a company's adherence to “do no harm” and is tightly knit together with ethical business conduct in areas such as human rights, child labour, illicit business, engagement in critical sectors, gender equality, etc..

The UN Global Compact principles emphasises:

> “_At a minimum, we expect businesses to undertake due diligence to avoid harming human rights and to address any adverse impacts on human rights that may be related to their activities_” ([Social Sustainability](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/our-work/social), UN Global Compact)

Community engagement is not a commonplace in sustainability reporting framework, principles and tools. However, it is not absent: stakeholder engagement including communities has become an aspect more and more common in the past years within the most accepted frameworks:

- The **[UN Global Compact](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/)** repeatedly stresses the proactive engagement with stakeholders and communities as [a good practice](https://d306pr3pise04h.cloudfront.net/docs/issues_doc%2Fhuman_rights%2FHuman_Rights_Working_Group%2FCommunityEngage_Inv_SupplyChain.pdf).
- The **[Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)](https://www.globalreporting.org/)** explicitly accommodates the disclosure of stakeholder engagement including with local communities through its topic standard 'GRI 413: Local Communities 2016'. If a business identifies impacts (material topic) on local communities, the GRI standard (under GRI3 'Material Topics') requires the business to transparently disclose which communities and stakeholders are affected, how it engages with them and what the means are for mitigating the impact.
- The **[ISO 26000](https://www.iso.org/iso-26000-social-responsibility.html)** is a comprehensive guide for corporate social responsibility. Unlike other standards in the field like the [ISO 14000 family](https://www.iso.org/iso-14001-environmental-management.html), companies cannot get certification. It provides comprehensive guidance on social sustainability from a holistic point of view. It focuses on seven core subjects including 'community involvement and development' (clause 6.8), which covers a range of guidance on issues like 'community involvement', 'education and culture', 'employment and skills', 'technology', 'wealth', 'health' and 'social investments'.
  ISO 26000 also aligns well with all major business sustainability initiatives like the [OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises](https://mneguidelines.oecd.org/) (more in this comparison by the [Danish Business Authority](http://iso26000.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Danish_Business_Authority__A_comparison_of_4_international_guidelines_for_CSR_2015.pdf))
- The **[B Corp Assessment](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/)** integrated community as one of five core impact areas (Governance, Workers, Community, Environment and Customers) through different lenses (diversity, equity & inclusion, economic impact, civic engagement, charitable giving, and supply chain management). What I like about B Corp is how it is not only helpful for 'conventional' business models. It is also attuned towards companies that are more sustainability-oriented by default through their business model (e.g. cooperatives, social enterprises, microenterprises, etc.).
- The **[Future Fit Business benchmark](https://futurefitbusiness.org/)** is different to other tools, because it recognises how doing business is integrated with environment and society rather a compromise/trade-off as inherently assumed in the common pillar model for sustainability. It's benchmark tool thus establishes (scientifically-backed) thresholds (similar to planetary boundaries). A sustainable business must stay within this boundaries and to do well is to create positive impact beyond the minimum. Community is reflected in this manner in the impact areas physical presence, people and to some extent also drivers.

## <a name="differentiation"></a> Community engagement for strategic differentiation and managing change

Actually, if we'd be serious about applying the net zero definition to social sustainability and community engagement, it would be not enough for them to comply with “do no harm”. Many companies activities are often extractive. They extract value from the community.

Many companies already work to balance the value extraction by proactively attempting to contribute positively e.g. in areas like job creation (e.g. hiring locally), education (e.g. up-skilling) and others.

As we see sustainability challenges accelerating rapidly, the evolution of business sustainability will see it go beyond CSR and net-zero. The question will soon be how companies can be net positive. “_Net positive companies thrive by giving more than they take [...] Net positive is about leaving a world better - and profiting as a result_” . ([Net positive manifesto](https://netpositive.world/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NP_deck_v5.pdf) by Paul Polman and Andrew Winston).

Paul Polman and Andrew Winston note though that

> No company has yet reached this lofty goal. But a growing number have begun the journey. ([Net positive manifesto](https://hbr.org/2021/09/the-net-positive-manifesto) by Paul Polman and Andrew Winston)

Community engagement will be central in this vision. I think whether tomorrow or even today, community engagement as central mechanism to sustainability management brings benefits in two areas:

- A **sustainable value proposition** will gain importance for strategic differentiation and competitive advantage.

  First, community engagement is an avenue for learning. The company's ability to learn from the engagement is an unique position to adapt and shape services and products for a better fit and for sustainable outcomes due to an intimate knowledge of experienced needs and challenges at hand.

  Second, the heterogenous nature of community is a great source for innovation and discovery. Innovation often emerges through chance encounters and the exposure to perspectives to ours. Community engagement is an opportunity to tap into the innovation potential that lies within the diversity of communities (<Link to="/three-steps-serenedipity-innovation/">Serendipity, innovation and change beyond small improvements</Link> by Wadim Baslow).

- **Managing change in the face of radical and disruptive change** will be a key ability for a company to successfully exist in the future.

  Community engagement is difficult. It requires the capability to engage with the heterogeneity of community, context, complexity and connectedness. However, the capabilities to do community engagement well are the dynamic capabilities a business requires to manage change.

  Executives and managers need to change existing models and paradigms to adapt to potentially radical and disruptive change. Businesses need to resolve the question how to make the best out its current resources (e.g. knowledge, talent) and build the capability and agility to learn quickly alongside emerging changes. A way to get better at it, I believe, is to do well with engaging in multi-stakeholder relationships and communities.

## <a name="mutuality"></a> Mutuality in business sustainability and community engagement

Community engagement is not a one-way street. Business efforts that are focusing e.g. on mitigating public backlash or obtaining insight from people disguised as community engagement will quickly be uncovered as not genuine. Once the trust is lost, it is not easily rebuilt.

Community engagement is also not stakeholder engagement. Stakeholder engagement is intensively interested in individual groups of stakeholders in isolation and how to engage with them in relation to the business and often neglects how stakeholders are intricately connected.

Thus, genuine community engagement in business sustainability is based on mutuality and connectedness ([Illustration “what the earth needs business to do”](https://imgur.com/a/w0aAMOp) by Piotr Drozd).

Businesses should follow four critical paths for businesses to succeed today and tomorrow are according to Paul Polman and Andrew Winston:

> _They can operate first in service of multiple stakeholders—which then benefits investors (as opposed to putting shareholders above all others); take full ownership of all company impacts; embrace deep partnerships, even with critics; and tackle systemic challenges by rethinking advocacy and the relationship with governments._

Also Harvard Professor [Michael Porter](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6532), renowned for his extensive work on business strategy, competitiveness in the face of different challenges, and Mark Kramer capture connectedness of the business through their [shared value theory](https://www.sharedvalue.org/about/what-is-shared-value/).

It acknowledges that no business exists on its own and is embedded in a wide web of relationships. 'Shared value' incorporates how a company's effort to create value beyond the mere economic interest opens the opportunity for innovating business models and creating more sustainable products. It emphasises how efforts to support and strengthen the 'ecosystem' has a positive spill-over effect across the actors including the business' own bottom line.

Taking community engagement beyond risk management and compliance is a business actively taking part in the broad sustainability transition. It creates value for multiple stakeholders including the business itself. Community engagement has a compounding effect. The value will not be apparent at first sight but will exponentially transformative over time.

## <a name="case"></a> Brief case study: Community funds

A company's contribution to a community engagement fund is a common among social sustainability instrument portfolios.

They aim to financially support community initiatives that stem from the community itself rather than imposing what the company believes a specific community needs. The management of the fund and its distribution is usually endowed to local stakeholders (e.g. the municipality).

The Danish renewable energy businesses [Ørsted](https://orsted.com/) or [European Energy](https://europeanenergy.com/) for example work with community engagement funds ([Community Benefit Funds](https://orsted.com/-/media/www/docs/corp/com/sustainability/our-local-community-engagement-uk-021117.ashx?la=en&hash=ab8806043011b9c661eb3f61304263d809473ed9) by Ørsted, [Community Funds](https://europeanenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sustainability-report-final.pdf) by European Energy).

Community funds are a great step. Yet, the way they are organised appear to miss the chance to leverage community engagement for learning, strengthening relationships, managing change and create sustainable value propositions.

The hands-off approach keeps community at arm's length. Genuine trust and relationship building will be more difficult this way.

I can imagine community funds could work more effectively taking a similar approach to community/neighbourhood development that [Participatory City](http://www.participatorycity.org/) & [Every One Every Day](https://www.weareeveryone.org/) take like (from the [Illustrative Guide to Participatory City](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55cdc310e4b0ff3ccdc21c1c/t/57c5ea502994ca25c1246726/1472588415822/Illustrated+Guide+to+Participatory+City+-+Download+version.pdf)):

- **Design principles for engagement that are based on everyday lives of people** taking like why engagement patterns are different today, why it is difficult to start an initiative etc.
- **Funding a support system** that provides a range of support functions for people to start, maintain and grow a community-based initiatives instead of funding initiatives directly.
- **No initial assessment of project ideas.** All proposed initiatives receive support with a focus on “testing and giving all ideas best chance for success”, instead of using competitive structures (selecting few ideas, etc).

The research of Participatory City revealed a straight-forward cause and effect chain: More support structure creates more projects, which creates more opportunities, which creates more participation, which creates more direct benefits to individuals, families and the neighbourhood as a whole.

In this thought experiment, I do not see businesses in the role of setting up, operating and supporting such support structures. They might want to instigate it. Mostly, I do see them contributing to the support system financially, conceptually and tactically in engagement with the community and the emerging portfolio of initiatives.

I think this might create a closer interface between the business and the communities it operates in. It might be the platform for mutual learning, co-design and perhaps creates sustainable value for many and the business.

Thank you,

Wadim
