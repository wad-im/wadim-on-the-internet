I observe small and medium sized companies' (SMEs) reluctance to seriously integrate sustainability aspects into their business. A different name for this organizational inertia can be addiction to business-as-usual. Overcoming addiction is difficult. Integrating sustainability can be a daunting feat, too.

People overcame alcohol, drug, food, gambling and other addictions. What can programs like [Anonymous Alcoholics](https://www.aa.org/), [Obesity Anonymous](https://oa.org/) or [Anonymous Gamblers](https://www.gamblersanonymous.org/ga/) teach us to overcome the addiction to business-as-usual?

Let us come out of denial, face reality, become actors not reactors, take responsibility, make patient small changes, ask for help and help others.

During the summer 2021, I worked together with electronics and sensor technology companies - members of the cluster [Strategische Partnerschaft Sensorik](https://www.sensorik-bayern.de/wer-wir-sind/) -on how to get started with sustainability. I want to share the steps we took as one way to get started ([Nachhaltigkeit im Sensorik-Netzwerk](https://www.sensorik-bayern.de/nachhaltigkeit/) - in German).

Essentially, the process comprised

- making recognised sustainability frameworks simpler in the beginning without compromising their essence,
- focusing on smaller changes rather than going all-in and thereby de-risking the effort,
- prioritising areas of potentially biggest initial impact,
- leverage community engagement and peer-to-peer network collaboration (e.g. the cluster).

Before jumping into the details of the process, let us illuminate some of the reasons behind SMEs' reluctance on business sustainability.

## Why SMEs are reluctant on business sustainability?

Sustainability can feel like a heavy object. The heavier the object, the more force is required to accelerate it (apologies for the sloppy use of [Newton's second law of motion](https://www.britannica.com/science/Newtons-laws-of-motion/Newtons-second-law-F-ma)). Unlike larger companies, who nowadays all have sustainability teams (or at least sustainability managers), SMEs work with different resource (e.g. smaller cash buffers), knowledge and technological constraints (e.g. lower uptake of digital tools and technologies).

Additionally, [Ernst et al. (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652621044383) list further reasons for SMEs' reluctance to embrace business sustainability:

- Some SMEs fail to see the economic relevance of sustainability in the long-term.
- Some SMEs feel they are just a small player and have no influence over customers, supply chain or sustainability at large. They perceive these as global issues outside their scope of responsibility and influence.
- Some SMEs act on sustainability due to external compliance force by regulation or supply chain. However, they “_often perceive legislation as a complex, unfair […] and demotivating external imperative that transforms their CS [corporate sustainability] engagement into an institutional ‘script' and compromises their self-determination_” ([Ernst et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652621044383)).

## Getting started on business sustainability in SMEs

Sustainability management integrated and disintegrated over the last years. It is no longer a peripheral business function and it developed a large landscape of principles, frameworks, tools and language which make it hard for the “outsider” and the “not-knowing” to enter.

Ahead of a series of workshops, the preparatory conversations with [Stefanie Fuchs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanie-fuchs) and [Matthias Streller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthiasstreller), cluster managers at the [Strategische Partnerschaft Sensorik](https://www.sensorik-bayern.de/wer-wir-sind/), indicated that most of the participating companies won't be very familiar with business sustainability.

My personal goal was to on-board the companies instead of deepening existing reservations. Making sustainability accessible. When designing the joint strategy development process, I concluded to follow these guiding principles:

- Make it more simple.
- Break down more complicated topics into smaller steps to be pieced together.
- No judgement.
- Make the process scalable (adding more complexity through iteration) and applicable at different levels (on the cluster level and in the individual organization).
- Work with a recognized sustainability framework.
- Encourage action.

Together, we mapped existing strengths & assets, identified impact areas and determined their significance and developed an initial strategic action catalogue. Finally, we used the gained insight to establish strategic future scenarios which became the target posts for a shared roadmap.

> Wadim and [Nicolai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolaisederbergrottboll/) provided us with advice and support for five months in order to make the big topic of "sustainability" more tangible for our network. The result was a "Sustainability Roadmap". This provides us with the necessary cornerstones for designing new offers and services for our members over the next 18 months. ([Stefanie Fuchs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanie-fuchs), Cluster Director)

Allow me to add details to each step:

### Mapping strengths & assets

We mapped existing strengths and assets that we can leverage in later in the process. The mapping included existing internal skills, investments, policies, strategies, manuals, technologies, and other existing or past actions in regards to sustainability.

The guiding question was:

_What are the activities the individual companies are already or have been performing on sustainability? What are existing assets, strengths and capabilities that can be leveraged?_

The approach was inspired by [positive psychology](https://positivepsychology.com/what-is-positive-psychology-definition/) and methods like [appreciate inquiry](https://appreciativeinquiry.champlain.edu/learn/appreciative-inquiry-introduction/), who pursue a strength-based instead of a deficit-based approach. I knew some companies came to the process with a heavy sigh and on defensive mode expecting to be blamed and judged.

I asked each company to cluster the emerging strength and asset items in the categories **energy, waste, water, natural resources, pollution, physical presence, people and driver**. These are the impact areas of [the Future-Fit Business Benchmark](https://futurefitbusiness.org/explore-the-benchmark/) - the sustainability framework I chose to scaffold the process (multiple reasons speak for Future-Fit. Its systemic approach makes the framework stand out for me).

Getting also a glimpse into what can potentially be, I guided the companies to explore their potential positive impact through two questions:

- What are the **close-by opportunities** for our products and services to speed up the sustainability transition?
- What are **further-out opportunities** for our products and services to speed up the sustainability transition?

**👉** *Outlook: the strength & asset mapping can provide insight into the increasing capability of the business to manage change.*

### Assessing business impact & identifying priority areas

We performed a simplified impact assessment exploring (honestly) what the impact of the business is.

I prepared an assessment matrix based off [the Future-Fit Business Benchmark](https://futurefitbusiness.org/explore-the-benchmark/). We used it to investigate the business' impact in energy, waste, water, natural resources, pollution, physical presence, people and drivers, in conjunction with its scope of influence:

- **Operations:** Negative impact through company's activities.
- **Product:** Negative effect caused through the product (forcing the customer to do harm)
- **Supply Chain**: Externalized negative effects through the supply chain
- **Society:** Hindering society to reduce or avoid negative effects.

The result was a map of the companies' negative sustainability impacts across impact areas and scope of influence. Three impact areas crystallised out of the process: energy, waste and people. We decided together to prioritize them moving forward.

I enjoyed in particular the honest account on the impact the sector it has through its material sourcing, product design and later disposal. Electronic waste e.g. is a big and unresolved issue and it really stood out in the assessment.

We rounded the assessment off with a forward-looking, action-oriented exercise identifying activities into five categories (inspired from [Feedback: Start, Stop, Continue](https://toolbox.hyperisland.com/feedback-start-stop-continue) from the [Hyper Island Toolbox](https://toolbox.hyperisland.com/)). What do we need to start, stop, continue, do more, do less of.

**👉** *Outlook: Impact assessments are core to sustainability management and reporting. The companies can (should) measure their sustainability performance for compliance (which at some point will take SMEs more into responsibility than it does now), and as management tool.*

### Defining and developing actions

Tackling the action inertia straight on, we continued by focusing on the barriers and obstacles that either **hold us back** to get started or cause a lot of **friction** along the journey.

We did in this two steps:

1. We identified for each impact area in each respective scope of influence what is stopping us to get started (inertia) and what is holding us back (friction).
2. Taking into account the strengths and assets that we mapped out before, and the catalogue of potential actions and activities that evolved along the way, we worked to put answers down on
   1. What steps are needed to overcome the identified barriers?, and
   2. Who will help? What can we do together (as a cluster)?

> Helping people to help themselves" is the motto by which we advise our network members. This is exactly how Wadim and Nicolai helped us. Instead of a standard model, we received valuable impulses and were able to develop a plan of action-oriented to the needs of our members - that allows us to take into account the very different points of view and development stages of the heterogeneous players in our cluster. ([Stefanie Fuchs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanie-fuchs), Cluster Director)

**👉** *Outlook: Removing barriers and obstacles make change and innovation more effective. Otherwise, barriers and obstacles become liabilities threatening the objectives of the sustainability-focused change management.*

### Strategic scenario building & backcasting

We used all the material that we developed until this point to create two future scenarios. I drew a timeline. It pointed towards the two future scenarios that emerged out of the group's work.

The scenarios helped us to set ambitious goals without the “pressure” to be able to answer exactly how we want to achieve them. I facilitated the exercise through “what if” questions (inspired by [Rob Hopkins](https://www.robhopkins.net/)) allowing us to tap into our creative and imaginary capabilities to develop more compelling narratives of what we want to achieve.

With our two scenarios set out, we walked back along the timeline to see what events, milestones and activities that occurred (seen from a future perspective) and illuminate the path to the scenarios' realization ([Backcasting - A framework for for strategic planning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249060842_Backcasting_-_A_framework_for_for_strategic_planning)).

**👉** *Outlook: Scenarios help to set targets. Companies will set concrete targets derived from the impact assessment. Additionally, scenarios are great to establish a strategic narrative to on-board the organization, spur creative energy and illuminate a potential path forward.*

### Developing a roadmap & setting accountability

The result was a roadmap including concrete actions, milestones and relevant stakeholders along the way.

In the end, we invested more time to add greater detail to the near-term activities (what are we doing next) and who is leading or part of bringing those activities to life (accountability).

The ball was rolling and that was important to me.

**👉** *Outlook: The company establishes a portfolio of concrete sustainability functions and actions across its business.*

## You are not alone

Research shows that regulatory pressure is often perceived by SMEs as demotivating external imperative. It reduces the self-determination and leads to watering down any efforts on corporate sustainability.

On the other side, business sustainability “_demands from proximate stakeholders who do not dictate the ‘rules of the game' but rather leave scope for managerial discretion and self-determination_” ([Ernst et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652621044383)). It turns out a businesses are more sensitive to demands from the communities they operate in.

As cheesy as it might sound, I do think that the “together we are stronger” motto is the credo to hold on to as SME on its sustainability journey:

Community engagement is a way to get a better grip on business sustainability - community as umbrella term for proximate stakeholders from the public, private, academic and civic realm alike. It creates a unique avenue to develop sustainable value propositions and strengthen capabilities to manage change. Both aspects will become more significant to the thriving or not thriving of a business in a future (see <Link to="/business-sustainability-community-engagement">Introduction: Local Community Engagement in Business Sustainability</Link>)

You can see clusters also as community. I think clusters provide an excellent opportunity for co-developing sustainability in the business and in the region. In a way, Michael Porter and Mark Cramer incorporated this notion through his [shared value theory.](https://www.sharedvalue.org/about/what-is-shared-value/)

Clusters like the [Strategische Partnerschaft Sensorik](https://www.sensorik-bayern.de/wer-wir-sind/) illustrate also their role as enablers and perhaps also as challengers. They invited their member companies to on-board sustainability, seek out themselves how they can support their members and kick-start progressive, challenging projects (e.g. on NextGen Printed Circuit Boards).

## Small steps & changes can have a big impact

Overcoming inertia can be hard. Like staying consistent on your New Year's resolution. Trying to tackle it all at once is sometimes too overwhelming ([Overcoming inertia: how small changes can have big impact | Kalipso Karantinou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uvUx57t838&ab_channel=TEDxTalks)).

Sustainability can be similar for small and medium sized companies. Instead of tackling it all at once, I wanted to show how the subject can be **more accessible by reducing the complexity of sustainability without compromising fundamental principles, scalability or accountability.**

It seems SMEs perceive a lack of agency when it comes to sustainability. I think they do have a lot of agency and especially so when not making the journey alone but together with their communities.

Thank you,

Wadim
