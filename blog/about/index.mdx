I want to share the process of discovery around my curiosities about sustainability and collaboration - both on a conceptual and practical level - with you and whoever it might resonate. and probably wander off-topic sometimes. It is anxiety-provoking and exciting at the same time.

I am based in Copenhagen, Denmark.

In the past 5 years I worked as a consultant and (senior) project manager helping different organizations and initiatives globally developing sustainability strategies, and designing, managing and facilitating multi-stakeholder initiatives ([my Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wbaslow/) for more info). I grew into it coming from studying sustainable urban development (M.Sc. in engineering), and environmental sciences & economics (B.Sc.).

I am a sustainability professional and became more confident over time with my interdisciplinary profile, because skills like navigating context, complexity and connectedness might turn out important for a sustainable transition and in radical and disruptive changes. The silver lining of my professional and academic career evolved around collaboration, participation, community and co-creation - enabling sustainable development by bringing many hands, minds and hearts together.

A couple of things come together in this blog.

- I taught myself to build and program websites in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemics, and reckoned I build 'digital garden' for myself.
- Few years ago I bought a camera and took pictures ever since. I didn't feel comfortable to share on social media, but more so here. I use them as hero images to my blogposts instead of stock images (the images are rarely related to the blog post's content).
- It demands some courage from me to share on this blog. Putting things out there that are not always at 100% seems daunting. Maybe it is because I am German. [Working out in the open](https://medium.com/open-change/working-in-the-open-162d6d747081), [putting forward half-baked work](https://seths.blog/2022/05/half-baked/) seems however a good way to connect with others in the field across the world and gain clarity over my own thought.

I invite you to connect with me.

Thank you,

Wadim
